            <h2>Extending XNAT towards a Cloud-based Quality Assessment Platform for Retinal Optical Coherence Tomographies</h2>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
               Neurosciencific research is increasingly based on image analysis methods. Large sets of imaging data are processed using complex image analysis tools. While today magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for both functional and anatomical analysis of the human brain, new imaging modalities are beginning to prove their capabilitiesfor neurological research. Among them, optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows for noninvasive visualization of anatomical structures on a micrometer scale. Becoming a standard diagnostic tool in ophthalmology, it is of rising interest for neurological research. Crucial to all data analysis methods
is the quality of the input data. The platform presented in this paper is designed for automatic quality assessment of retinal OCTs. It extends the image management platform XNAT by services to calculate and store quality measures. It is also extensible regarding new quality measure algorithms, allowing the developer to upload Matlab code, compile it for the infrastructure’s hardware architecture and test it in the system. The image processing tools to calculate the quality measures
are provided as a cloud-based service employing OpenStack as underlying IT infrastructure. The prototype implementation encompassing security and performance aspects are presented.
