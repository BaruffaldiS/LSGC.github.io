            <h2>Sustainable Ultrascale Computing Systems: Applications in Biomedicine and Bioengineering</h2>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>With the advent of ultrascale computing systems, envisioned as large-scale complex systems joining parallel and distributed computing systems that will be two to three orders of magnitude larger that today´s systems, clouds will play a major role as an integration and support platform to provide every kind of virtual computing environment (HPC, HTC, data centers, etc.). However, as the scale grows, it is more and more difficult to provide efficient and sustainable solutions. This talk will present NESUS, Network for Sustainable Ultrascale Computing Systems, focused on coordinating research efforts to provide novel contributions towards increasing the sustainability of ultrascale cloud computing systems with a holistic approach. The talk will show challenges and emerging trends in those areas, and how those systems could enhance research in biomedicine and bioengieering.

            <h3>About Jesus Carretero</h3>

            <p>
            Jesus Carretero is a Full Professor of Computer Architecture and Technology at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain), where he is responsible for that knowledge area since 2000. He is also Director of the Master in Administration and Management of Computer Systems, which he founded in 2004. He is a project reviewer for Spanish research ministry and also European Union. 
His research activity is centered on high-performance computing systems, large-scale distributed systems and real-time systems. He has participated and leaded several national and international research projects in these areas, founded by Madrid Regional Government, Spanish Education Ministry and the European union. He was teaching in Facultad de Informática of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (Spain) since 1989 until 1997. In 1997 and 1998 he was a visiting scholar at the NorthWestern University of Chicago (Ill, USA).  He has published more than 180 papers in journals and international conferences, editor of several books of proceedings, and guest editor for special issues of journals as Intenationl Journal of Parallel Processing, Cluster Computing, Computers and Electrical Engineering, and New Generation Computing, and he is coauthor of several text books related to Operationg Systems and Computer Architecture. He has participated in many conference organization committees, and he has been General chair of HPCC 2011 and MUE 2012, and Program Chair of ISPA 2012, EuroMPI 2013, C4Bio 2014, and ESAA 2014. Prof. Carretero is a senior member of the IEEE Computer Society and member of the ACM.
He works currently at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, where he has been teaching since 2000. Carretero is a senior member of the IEEE Computer Society and member of the ACM.</p>
