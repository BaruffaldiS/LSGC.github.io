            <h2>Biomedical Clouds and Biomedical Data Commons And Why They Are Changing Health Care Research</h2>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
               As biomedical datasets continue to grow in size, biomedical clouds and commons of biomedical data are beginning to play an important role in the research community. We survey some of the recent developments in the field and discuss some important technical challenges. In particular, we discuss some of the ways that biomedical clouds are beginning to interoperate. We also discuss some of the lessons learned over the past couple of years as we operated the petabyte-scale Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud (PDC), which contains data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
