            <h2>Science gateways for medical imaging: VIP, CBRAIN, and their interoperability</h2>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
		Science gateways have changed the practice of science by enabling transparent, web access to computing infrastructures and to federated databases. The Virtual Imaging Platform (VIP) and the Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platforms (CBRAIN) are two science gateways for medical imaging, that operate on the European Grid Infrastructure and on Compute Canada respectively. We will describe the architecture of these science gateways and the features that led to their adoption by a wide community of users. In particular, based on examples extracted from applications and projects, we will present our algorithms and systems for self management, load balancing, and the deployment of virtual machines.  We believe that science gateways should now be connected in a world-wide network of interoperable platforms. We will describe our current efforts to design systems and interfaces that enable the exchange and uniform remote invocation of applications in science gateways.

            <h3>About Tristan Glatard</h3>

            <p>
Tristan Glatard is research scientist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), currently a Visiting Scholar at McGill University. His research interests include neuroinformatics, grid and cloud computing, science gateways, and performance optimization of medical imaging applications. He has published 70+ peer-reviewed papers in international journals and conference proceedings, and has been involved in several European and French funded projects, in particular SHIWA, ER-flow, Neugrid for users, and France Life-Imaging. He contributed to a few software projects used for medical image analysis, including the MOTEUR workflow system, the Dutch Virtual Laboratory for Medical Image Analysis, and the Virtual Imaging Platform. VIP is a widely used platform with 700+ users from 50+ countries. Tristan Glatard also coordinated the Life-Science Grid Community (until 2013), an organization representing life-science users of the European Grid Infrastructure, and the biomed Virtual Organization, the corresponding technical entity.
