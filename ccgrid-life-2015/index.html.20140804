            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
               In the last 20 years, computational methods have become an important part of developing emerging technologies for the field of bioinformatics and biomedicine. Research areas such as biomodelling, molecular dynamics, genomics, neuroscience, cancer models, evolutionary biology, medical biology, biochemistry, biophysics, biotechnology, cell biology, nanobiotechnology, biological engineering, pharmacology, genetics therapy, or automatic diagnosis, rely heavily on large scale computational resources as they need to manage Tbytes or Pbytes of data with large-scale structural and functional relationships, TFlops or PFlops of computing power for simulating highly complex models, or many-task processes and workflows for processing and analyzing data.
            </p>
            <p>
            This new situation demands appropriate IT-infrastructures, where bioinformatic and medical data can be processed within an acceptable timespan - reaching from minutes in health-care applications to days in large-scale research projects. Large-scale distributed IT-systems such as Grids, Clouds and Big-Data-Environments are promising to address research, clinical and medical research community requirements. They allow for significant reduction of computational time for running large experiments, for speeding-up the development time for new algorithms, for increasing the availability of new methods for the research community, and for supporting large-scale multi-centric collaborations. However, specific challenges in the employment of such systems for medical applications such as security, reliability and user-friendliness, often impede straightforward adoption of existing solutions from other application domains. 
            </p>
            <p>
               This workshop aims at bringing together developers of bioinformatic and
medical applications and researchers in the field of distributed IT 
systems. On the one hand, it addresses researchers who are already 
employing distributed infrastructure techniques in bioinformatic applications,
 in particular scientists developing data- and compute-intensive bioinformatic and medical
 applications that include multi-data studies, large-scale parameter 
scans or complex analysis pipelines. On the other hand, it addresses 
computer scientists working in the field of distributed systems 
interested in bringing new developments into bioinformatic and medical applications.
            </p>
            <p>
               The goals are to exchange and discuss existing solutions 
and latest developments in both fields, and to gather an overview of 
challenges (technologies, achievements, gaps, roadblocks). The workshop 
further intends to identify common requirements to lead future 
developments in collaboration between Life Sciences and Computing Sciences, and
 to collaboratively explore new ideas and approaches to successfully 
apply distributed IT-systems in translational research, clinical 
intervention, and decision-making.
